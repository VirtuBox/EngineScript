# **EngineScript - Automated WordPress LEMP Server**

EngineScript automates the process of building a high-performance LEMP server.

We've specifically built EngineScript with WordPress users in mind.

As this is a pre-release version, things might be totally broken day-to-day as we test different methods of building the server.

If you'd like to test EngineScript for yourself, just enter the command below into your favorite SSH client. This should be done on a fresh server with no current Nginx, PHP, or MySQL clients currently installed.

**Install EngineScript**
```shell
sudo curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VisiStruct/EngineScript/master/Initial-Setup.sh && chmod 0700 Initial-Setup.sh && sudo bash Initial-Setup.sh
```
